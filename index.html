      </h3>

      <p>MacCallister Higgins (shorthand == Mac) is a full-stack robotics engineer and entrepreneur with a track record
        of spinning up and
        delivering new projects with a variety of team sizes. He co-founded a company that deployed self-driving cars
        across the country, developed physical awareness technology for manned and autonomous military aircraft, and
        most recently has been architecting the next-generation of drone delivery systems for Amazon at Prime Air.</p>

      </h3>

      <p>At Prime Air, Mac utilized his robotics and software background to develop technical roadmaps and
        models for the long-term evolution of the Amazon drone delivery system, working across teams and organizations
        to build consensus around deep and complex technical topics.
        He developed full-system CONOPs (Concept of Operations) for future iterations, and performed trade
        studies by building proof-of-concept software implementations of proposed features, creating
        system models, and deep diving into all aspects of the system across hardware, software, and human
        organizations.

          was acquired by Cruise in March 2021.</a></p>

      <p>As a Co-Founder at Voyage, Mac was responsible for developing both the architecture
        and direct implementation of localization, perception, mapping, low level controls, and navigation code on the
        technology and algorithms team. He helped shape the earliest days of the Voyage spin-out,
        contributing to fundraising, recruiting, team organization, and other high-level company efforts.</p>

      <p>As the Director of Growth (Nov 2017-Oct 2019), it was his responsibility to make sure that Voyage vehicles were
        everywhere customers wanted to use them. As the first person on the ground in new deployments, he evaluated the
        technical feasibility of the taxi service, coordinated with mapping partners and community stakeholders, handled
        the logistics behind building remote operations centers and new teams, and handled directed engineering
        projects specific to the growth story (such as building private wireless networks and infrastructure sensing
        capabilities).</p>

      </h3>

      <p>Mac founded and began recruiting for NVD in 2014, initially as a senior project at the
        University of Nevada. After quickly attracting coding talent (<a href="https://github.com/WarGravy"
          class="user-mention">@WarGravy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lavahot" class="user-mention">@lavahot</a>, <a
          href="https://github.com/dquinnfrank" class="user-mention">@dquinnfrank</a>), the NVD team set out to create a
        product that brought drones from the hobbyist world to the everyday consumer. By massively simplifying the
        process of long-range communication, path planning, localization, and visualization, the NVD platform
        provided any business that wanted to use drones the ability to do so, while reducing (and eliminating many)
        technical and regulatory
        barriers.</p>

      <p>At the time (and to be honest, still to this day), any company that wanted to send a drone across a city ran
        into many problems, including obstacle
        avoidance, adherence to local and national laws, long distance monitoring, and expensive pilots. By connecting
        drones to the internet, NVD provided the technology infrastructure required to integrate existing drone
        systems into a safe, commercial environment, where drones could be sent anywhere with the click of a button or
        swipe of a finger, and data could be immediately uploaded and visualized. As a cool note, he's pretty sure that
        they developed the very first (public) web-based ground control station.</p>

      <p>Mac also helped lead the <a

          self-driving car effort</a> of putting an autonomous car on the road -- which drove with zero disengagements
        from Mountain View to South San Francisco on surface streets -- using open-source talent from around the
        world with his unique leadership and engineering background. Before this, he worked on real-time Radar and Lidar
        sensor systems at SNC, developing next-generation environmental and physical awareness technologies for both
        fixed wing and rotor aircraft.</p>

      <p>He graduated from the department of Computer Science and Engineering at
        the University of Nevada, with multi-disciplinary research roles in the fields of Human-Robot Interaction
        and large-scale control of Unmanned Autonomous Systems for the UNR Robotics group, including failure
        contingencies and safety systems. He also worked at the Polymer Microsystems (PlUS) Lab under Dr. Geiger,
        developing lab technologies and assisting in many projects alongside PhD,
        masters, and undergraduate students. This position had him developing control system circuit board hardware,
        writing the software for those embedded systems, and implementing radio mesh networks for NASA. </p>
