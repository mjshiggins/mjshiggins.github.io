{"name":"MacCallister Higgins","tagline":"","body":"### About Mac\r\nMacCallister Higgins is the CEO and lead software developer at Nevada Dynamics, software engineer at a nameless defense contractor, and recently graduated student researcher from the department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno. He performed research in the field of Human-Robot Interaction, as well as the large-scale control of Unmanned Autonomous Systems for the UNR Robotics group, including failure contingencies and safety systems. He also worked at the Polymer Microsystems (PlUS) Lab under Dr. Geiger from early 2011 to 2014, developing lab technologies and assisting in several key, funded projects alongside PhD, masters, and undergraduate students. This position had him developing control system circuit board hardware, writing the software for those embedded systems, implementing radio mesh networks for NASA, and [writing published journal papers](https://ejg.blogs.unr.edu/publications/). Currently, he works full time at a defense contractor, developing next-generation environmental and physical awareness technologies for both fixed wing and rotor aircraft. As the CEO of Nevada Dynamics, he is also focused on leading a startup company that aims to enable the widespread, commercial use of drones. Technology wise, this involves everything from writing Android apps, designing embedded C programs for things that fly, and architecting large-scale cloud infrastructures that process real-time, spatial data.\r\n\r\n### Nevada Dynamics\r\n\r\nMacCallister founded and began recruiting for Nevada Dynamics in 2014, initially as a senior project at the University of Nevada. After quickly attracting coding talent (@WarGravy, @lavahot, @dquinnfrank), the NVD team set out to create a product that brought drones from the hobbyist world to the everyday consumer. By massively simplifying the process of long-range communication, path planning, localization, and visualization, the NVD infrastructure looks to provide any business that wants to use drones the ability to do so, without any technical or regulatory barriers.\r\n\r\n>#####Want to hear about Nevada Dynamics from someone else besides me?\r\n\r\n>* Check out [this TV spot](http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/UNR-Students-Developing-New-Drone-Technology-297605631.html) about NVD winning the largest collegiate entrepreneurship competition in the country\r\n>* Here's a [great article](http://www.unr.edu/nevada-today/news/2015/nevada-dynamics) from the University of Nevada\r\n>* A [quick spot on Interdrone](http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/conference-examines-the-future-of-drones), the largest drone conference in the world, where NVD took home the designation of one of top 10 coolest companies by [Flystro](http://flystro.com/the-10-coolest-companies-at-interdrone/)\r\n>* An [AOPA article](http://www.aopa.org/News-and-Video/All-News/2015/September/16/Preventing-drone-disaster) that features an interview with Mac and NVD\r\n\r\nCurrently, any company that wants to send a drone across a city runs into many problems, including obstacle avoidance, adherence to local and national laws, long distance monitoring, and expensive pilots. By connecting drones to the internet, Nevada Dynamics provides the technology infrastructure to integrate existing drone systems into a safe, commercial environment, where drones can be sent anywhere with the click of a button or swipe of a finger, and data can be immediately uploaded and visualized.\r\n\r\nThe NVD system can be installed on a drone using an onboard Android cell phone (with our Totem app) or small Linux computer (running Totem software), connecting to the internet through a Drone Data Plan that we provide though strategic partnerships with cellular carriers, and operating with low-latency, encrypted, lightweight messages. The control client can then be run from any web browser, mobile or desktop. This enables drones to be sent anywhere to film anything, deliver any package, monitor any security perimeter, or anything else imaginable. \r\n\r\nThe cloud connectivity; however, is simply a means to an end, as we enable the drones themselves to create custom flight plans that avoid buildings, other aircraft, and no-fly zones, while integrating with the national Unmanned Traffic Management system currently being developed by NASA and the FAA. Nevada Dynamics believes that controlling drones should be simple and intuitive, not complicated and filled with regulatory compliance training.\r\n\r\nBy moving the common \"ground control station\" to the cloud, Nevada Dynamics has eliminated complexity and enabled any company to navigate this new market and use drones to their maximum potential, in the absolute easiest way possible by directly using our web control station, contracting with us to build specific drone applications, or by taking advantage of our open API and building on top of our system. This platform can move in many different directions, and we look forward to adding to our list of collaborators, which currently includes universities, large international and domestic drone and autopilot manufacturers, UAS-service based companies, national cellular networks, and state governments.

If you are looking for an embedded systems engineer, spatial data software developer, or someone who is really excited about flying robots, feel free to contact him over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maccallister-higgins-ab997457). Hint: He really wants to travel.\r\n\r\n### Postgraduate Studies\r\nMacCallister is also interested in furthering his education. Nevada Dynamics has a policy of encouraging postgraduate work that benefits the company, and is interested in developing strong public/private partnerships. You're not just getting a student with extensive technical writing and research experience, you're getting a startup founder looking to implement these technologies in the real world, solving real problems.\r\n\r\n> If you run a lab that does work in Unmanned Aerial Systems and you're looking for your next researcher, please contact Mac over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maccallister-higgins-ab997457). \r\n> Especially if you're doing cool stuff like [swarms](http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:6924/eth-6924-02.pdf), [imagery fusion/VR](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pscerri/papers/AIAAOwens.pdf), or [path planning](http://uarc.ucsc.edu/flight-control/libofn/papers/AIAA2008_Tsenkov.pdf)  \r\n\r\nChallenges both MacCallister and NVD are interested in solving: Multi-Agent SLAM, UAV Localization, UAV swarm cooperation and mapping, 3D environment reconstruction\r\n\r\n### CV and Contact\r\nYou've made it this far, so I hope you don't mind that I start talking in first-person now.
